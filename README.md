# 2020

# 20 things I will not allow more than once or twice this year: 

1. Eating junk food from large fast food chains (Including McDonald's, Burger King, Five Guys, St Hubert, KFC, Taco Bell, Wendy's, Tim Hortons)
2. Checking Twitter other than exactly at 6:30 or 8:30 (Notifications off)
3. Viewing Snapchat other than exactly at 21:29 or 12:51
4. Missing 2 consecutive workout days (Injuries or doctors advice count as exceptions)
5. Not commiting on public Github projects daily (A white block in my 2020 commit graph is unacceptable)
6. Watching TikTok other than exactly at 8:00 or 23:11
7. Not posting on TikTok daily at 8:20 or 20:20
8. Sitting down on Toilet seats (Only squatting is allowed to minimize time spent in washrooms)
9. Eating Poutine, Donuts, or Bagels 
10. Consuming alcohol
11. Checking email during business hours (Before 9am or after 5pm only - prioritize SMS MFA and confirmation)
12. Not posting on LinkedIn once a week
13. Not going out on a date night at least once a month
14. Using onling banking from the big 5 banks (Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology will be used for all online exchanges of value)
15. Watching sports outside of a gym or not live from the event itself
16. Not eating a serving of fruit or vegatables every day
17. Using the Google Maps application (Transit and Arcane Maps will be used)
18. Using a mobile phone inside the house other than to use it as a house phone connected to a charger, data tethering device, or for sending text messages
19. Attending tech meetup nights (unless I am speaking or presenting at it, sponsoring it, or am working from it)
20. Withholding from releasing a piece of music every month)
I just will not allow any of these things in 2020 and should have a much better year.
