# 20 things I, David Wawryko, will not allow more than once or twice this year: 

1. Eating junk food from large fast food chains (Including McDonald's, Burger King, Five Guys, St Hubert, KFC, Taco Bell, Wendy's, Tim Hortons)

8. _____
9. Eating Donuts, or Bagels 
10. Consuming alcohol
11. Checking email during business hours (Before 9am or after 5pm only - prioritize SMS MFA and confirmation)
12. Not posting on LinkedIn once every two weeks

I just will not allow any of these things in 2020 and should have a much better year.
